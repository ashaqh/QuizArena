# ✅ App is Running - Test the Score Fix Now!

## Good News! 🎉
The app is successfully running on your device(s). I can see from the logs:
- ✅ App installed successfully
- ✅ Environment variables loaded
- ✅ Firebase initialized successfully

The Gradle errors are just related to multiple device deployment conflicts, but the app is working fine.

## 🧪 Now Test the Score Fix:

### Step 1: Clear Your Game History
1. Open the app on your device
2. Go to **Profile tab** (bottom right icon)
3. Scroll down to **"Account"** section
4. Tap **"Clear Game History"**
5. Confirm the action ✅

### Step 2: Test With a New Game
1. **Option A: Join a Game**
   - Go to **Join tab**
   - Enter a game code from someone else
   - Play and score points
   - Check Dashboard → Recent Activity

2. **Option B: Host a Game** 
   - Go to **Host tab**
   - Create/select a quiz
   - Start the game
   - Complete it
   - Check Dashboard → Recent Activity

### Step 3: Verify the Fix
After completing a game:
1. Go to **Stats tab** (Dashboard)
2. Look at **"Recent Activity"** section
3. **You should now see actual points** instead of 0!

## 🔍 What to Look For:

**Before Fix:** All games showed `0 pts` ❌  
**After Fix:** Games show actual scores like `850 pts`, `1200 pts` ✅

## 🚨 If You Still See 0 Points:
- Make sure you **cleared game history first**
- The fix only works for **new games after clearing**
- Old games will still show 0 (that's expected)

## 🎯 Expected Results:
- **Dashboard Quick Stats**: Should update with new game data
- **Recent Activity**: Should show actual points earned
- **Game History**: Should show correct scores

The app is ready for testing! Let me know what you see after playing a new game. 🚀
