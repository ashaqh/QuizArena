# QuizArena Authentication Flow

## Overview
The QuizArena app now implements a robust authentication system that ensures only logged-in users can access protected features like quiz creation, game hosting, statistics, and profile management.

## Authentication Architecture

### 1. Entry Point (main.dart)
- **SplashWrapper**: Shows splash screen for 3 seconds, then transitions to AuthWrapper
- **AuthWrapper**: Monitors Firebase authentication state using `StreamBuilder<User?>`

### 2. Authentication State Management
The app uses Firebase Auth's `authStateChanges()` stream to automatically detect when users log in or out:

```dart
StreamBuilder<User?>(
  stream: FirebaseAuth.instance.authStateChanges(),
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    // Show splash while checking auth state
    if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
      return const SplashScreen();
    }

    // If authenticated → MainNavigationScreen (full app access)
    if (snapshot.hasData && snapshot.data != null) {
      return const MainNavigationScreen();
    }

    // If not authenticated → LoginScreen only
    return const LoginScreen();
  },
)
```

### 3. Protected Features
When users are **logged in**, they have access to:
- ✅ **Host Tab**: Create and manage quizzes
- ✅ **Join Tab**: Join existing games
- ✅ **Stats Tab**: View personal dashboard and game history
- ✅ **Profile Tab**: Manage account and preferences
- ✅ **Bottom Navigation**: Full app navigation

When users are **logged out**, they only see:
- ❌ **Login Screen Only**: No access to any other features

### 4. Sign In Methods
The app supports multiple authentication methods:
- **Email/Password**: Traditional account creation and login
- **Google Sign-In**: OAuth integration with Google accounts
- **Anonymous Sign-In**: Guest access (still gets full features but data isn't persistent)

### 5. Sign Out Behavior
When users sign out:
1. **Firebase Auth State Changes**: `FirebaseAuth.instance.signOut()` is called
2. **Automatic Navigation**: AuthWrapper detects the state change
3. **Immediate Redirect**: User is automatically sent to LoginScreen
4. **Protected Features Blocked**: All app features become inaccessible

## Key Security Features

### ✅ Stream-Based Authentication
- Uses Firebase's `authStateChanges()` stream for real-time auth monitoring
- No manual navigation needed - all routing is automatic
- Prevents any bypass of authentication checks

### ✅ No Manual Navigation
- Login screen doesn't manually navigate after successful login
- Logout doesn't manually navigate after sign out
- AuthWrapper handles all navigation based on auth state

### ✅ Complete Feature Protection
- MainNavigationScreen only accessible to authenticated users
- All dashboard features require authentication
- No backdoor access to protected screens

## Testing the Authentication Flow

### To Test Login Protection:
1. Start the app (shows splash screen)
2. After 3 seconds, should show login screen
3. Try to access any features → should be blocked

### To Test Full Access After Login:
1. Sign in with any method (email, Google, or guest)
2. Should automatically navigate to main app with bottom tabs
3. All features should be available

### To Test Logout Protection:
1. While logged in, go to Profile tab
2. Tap logout button and confirm
3. Should immediately return to login screen
4. All features should become inaccessible

## File Changes Made

### Modified Files:
- **main.dart**: Added SplashWrapper and updated AuthWrapper routing
- **splash_screen.dart**: Removed authentication logic, now just shows UI
- **login_screen.dart**: Removed manual navigation, relies on AuthWrapper

### Unchanged Files:
- **profile_screen.dart**: Already had proper logout implementation
- **user_data_service.dart**: Authentication-dependent services work correctly
- **main_navigation.dart**: Protected by AuthWrapper, no changes needed

## Conclusion
The authentication system now provides bulletproof protection where:
- **Logged out users**: Can only see the login screen
- **Logged in users**: Have full access to all app features
- **State changes**: Are handled automatically in real-time
- **No manual routing**: Everything is handled by the authentication stream

This ensures a secure and user-friendly experience where authentication state is always properly enforced.
