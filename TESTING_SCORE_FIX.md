# Testing the Dashboard Score Fix

## Why You're Still Seeing 0 Points

The reason you're still seeing 0 points is because **the existing game history records in your database still contain the old incorrect data**. The fix I implemented only affects **new games** going forward.

## Solution: Clear Game History for Testing

I've added a convenient way to clear your game history so you can test the fix with fresh data.

### Step 1: Clear Your Game History
1. **Open the app** and go to the **Profile tab** (bottom right)
2. **Scroll down** to the "Account" section
3. **Tap "Clear Game History"** 
4. **Confirm** the action

This will:
- ✅ Delete all existing game records (with 0 points)
- ✅ Reset your statistics to zero
- ✅ Keep your user profile intact
- ✅ Prepare for testing with fresh data

### Step 2: Test the Fix
After clearing your history:

1. **Host a Game:**
   - Go to Host tab → Create a quiz → Start game
   - Complete the game
   - Check Dashboard → Recent Activity (should show correct data)

2. **Join a Game:**
   - Go to Join tab → Enter game code → Play game
   - Score some points during gameplay
   - Check Dashboard → Recent Activity (should show your actual score)

## What to Expect

### Before Fix (Old Behavior):
- Dashboard Recent Activity: `0 pts` for all games
- Even if you scored 800 points, it showed `0 pts`

### After Fix (New Behavior):
- Dashboard Recent Activity: Shows actual points earned
- If you score 800 points, it will show `800 pts`
- If you score 1200 points, it will show `1200 pts`

## Technical Explanation

### Why Old Data Still Shows 0:
- Old game records were saved with incorrect player lookup
- They contain `playerScore: 0` in the database
- Dashboard loads this old incorrect data

### Why New Games Will Work:
- ✅ Code now passes actual `Player` object with real score
- ✅ Correct `playerScore` gets saved to database
- ✅ Dashboard displays the correct score

## Alternative: Wait for New Games
If you don't want to clear your history:
- **Keep your existing data** (even though it shows 0 points)
- **Play some new games** after the fix
- **New games will show correct points** in Recent Activity
- **Old games will still show 0 points** (but that's expected)

## Verification Steps

1. **Clear game history** using the new button
2. **Play a complete game** (host or join)
3. **Go to Dashboard** → Recent Activity
4. **Verify the game shows actual points** instead of 0

## Files Modified for Testing
- `lib/services/user_data_service.dart` - Added `clearGameHistory()` method
- `lib/screens/dashboard/profile_screen.dart` - Added "Clear Game History" button

The app should now be building and ready for testing. Once you clear your game history and play a new game, you'll see the correct points displayed in the dashboard!
